Something that caught my attention were Librarians because I didn't know High School teachers and Librairans earned almost equal amounts for salary. I was expecting Librarians to be making a lot lower amount. Also, another one that was suprising was the coaches and Scouts (for athletics). I'd thought they would be making much more. Until I read the description that it was for amature sports.


My rankings

(BEST)
Data Scientist ( Because it has the highest Job outlook)
Physicist and Astronomer( because it pays the most, but it does require at least a Doctoral degree)
Police/Detectives ( has ok job outlook, pay, but need to complete additional training )
Librarians ( Has ok pay, but requires master's degree - not good ROI)
Food Service Managers( has bad pay, and small job outlook)
Cook( very small pay)
High School Teacher (negative job outlook and small salary)
(WORST)
